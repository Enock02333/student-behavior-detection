# student-behavior-detection
A project to detect and classify student behaviors in classrooms using YOLOv8.

This repository contains a computer vision project aimed at detecting and classifying student behaviors in classroom settings using YOLO-based object detection models. The project leverages the students-behaviors-detection dataset, available on Roboflow, and integrates state-of-the-art techniques for behavior recognition and analysis.

Project Overview
Purpose
The goal of this project is to automate the detection of classroom behaviors to enhance educational monitoring and improve teaching strategies. The system detects various behaviors such as reading, writing, raising hands, following instructions, and more, using a YOLO-based object detection model.
